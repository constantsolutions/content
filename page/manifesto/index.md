I am driven by technology that connects people and improves quality-of-life, and when I am building new products I thrive.

I share my knowledge on this blog, in an attempt to help you succeed with yourÂ technology project. I feel quite passionate about this subject, and it has been my main interest since 2002.

I hope that your time spent brain-picking me will be worth your time. If this is not the case, please don't hesitate to [let me know how I may help](https://constantsolutions.dk/contact/). I am still in beta.
