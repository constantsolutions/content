Anyone can record the screen easily.

If you prefer not to download any additional software to record your screen, chances are you already have a program that can do it for you. Luckily, if you're on Mac, you can simply open QuickTime Player. On Windows you'll need PowerPoint, or other download alternative (free) software - but don't worry, this is easy.

# On Mac OS
